# Undergrad Thesis - Framework to Implement Iterative Algorithms on Distributed Systems

## Abstract
In this thesis, I build a framework for implementing iterative algorithms by abstracting the code for node communication. This thesis explains the building of said framework using a distributed algorithm and introduces the tools and methods used. I first implemented an algorithm and tested it out on a testbed of 15 Raspberry piâ€™s. After the desired functionality was met, I then went on to proceed with abstracting the code so that similar iterative algorithms could reuse the parts of the code that dealt with inter-node communication and communication link setup.
